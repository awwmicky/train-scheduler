< notes >

= requirements =
- adding trains specs
	- train name
	- destination
	- First Train Time -- in military time
	- Frequency -- in minutes
- app calculates next train arrival
	- relative to the current time
	- (estimate time or arrival)
- using firebase to store data
	- users view from different PC browsers
	- must be able to view same train schedule

= Pseudo Code =
- event listener
	- fill form
	- saves all information
	- append to the DOM
- moment.js
	- takes snapshot of real world time
	- use input time & relative time for difference for ETA
	- convert time to interval time minutes 

- firebase
	- storing the time
	- store information from form
	- view information from DB to DOM


= BONUS =
- "minutes to arrival" & "next train time"
- apdate & remove button
- only sign people can edit


= OTHER =
- update Next Arrival in realtime
- update ETA in realtime
- if 0, then ARRIVED
- convert military time to western time

- convert input type time to number
- apply min & max to input numbers

===
/* 
e.g: example timer math
- assume the first train time arrives at 8:00 AM
- assume current time now is 7:30 AM
- we know it's 30 min difference

- confirm process that meets example test
*/

/* 
- calculate minutes away & next arrival time
- based on current time
- how many minutes away is the next train?
*/

/*
- Assume the following situation
= test 1 = 
- first train is of the day is 3:00 AM
- assume the train comes every 3 minutes
- assume the train current time is 3:16 AM
- what time would the next train be???
	- it would be 3:18 — 2 minutes away
	- but how (in math)?
= answer 1 =
16 - 00 = 16 (first train time)
16 % 3 = 1 (modulus/remainder) 
3 - 1 = 2 (minutes away)
2 + 3:16 = 3:18 (next train time)

= test 2 =
- first train is of the day is 3:00 AM
- assume the train comes every 7 minutes
- assume the train current time is 3:16 AM
- what time would the next train be???
	- it would be 3:21 — 5 minutes away
	- but how (in math)?
= answer 2 =
16 - 00 = 16 (first train time)
16 % 7 = 2 (modulus/remainder)
7 - 2 = 5 (minutes away)
5 + 3:16 = 3:21 (next train time)
